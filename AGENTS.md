# Repository Guidelines

## Testing
Run `python3 test.py` from the repository root. This test suite requires the compiled `_game` module. If the module or dependencies are missing, tests may fail; note this in the Testing section.

## Code Style
- Use four spaces for indentation in both Python and C++ files.
- Keep lines under 120 characters where practical.
- Python variable and function names should be in `snake_case`.
- C++ class names should use `CamelCase`.

## Commit Messages
Describe changes clearly in the commit message. If multiple logical changes are made, separate them into individual commits when possible.
