# Recovered game snapshot

Original commit: `4b3902d44f874a1fae86054d7240a2af76901bb4`. Original tree: `1cbea618228ae2ccfe403974781f0d171c089189`.
Startup was verified from identical recovered sources at `4b3902d44f874a1fae86054d7240a2af76901bb4`.

This recovered version compiled and linked on Linux, started the real game on an isolated Xvfb display,
loaded its map and a healthy player, rendered the screenshot below, and exited normally.

## Build and run

Install Qt 5 Core, Gui and Widgets development files and a C++ compiler, with CPython 3.4 development files and its matching Boost.Python library. The verified tool versions were:

- g++-5 (Ubuntu 5.4.0-6ubuntu1~16.04.12) 5.4.0 20160609
- QMake version 3.0
- Using Qt version 5.5.1 in /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu

Build from this snapshot's root directory:

```sh
qmake game.pro QMAKE_CC=gcc-5 QMAKE_CXX=g++-5 QMAKE_LINK=g++-5 -after TARGET=RecoveryGame DESTDIR=.
make -j"$(nproc)"
./RecoveryGame
```

For an isolated launch, use:

```sh
LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE=1 QT_OPENGL=software xvfb-run -a --server-args="-screen 0 1920x1080x24" ./RecoveryGame
```

The automated readiness observer used for verification is recorded in the attached evidence; ordinary
launches run the game's original entry point. Startup evidence does not establish full gameplay equivalence.

The actual 1278 × 718 screenshot and [verification metadata](recovery/verification.json) belong to
this source version. Reconstructed code and borrowed assets are identified in that metadata; they are
not claimed to be the original deleted bytes. BFG removal-marker files are absent from this snapshot.
