market bug/when configuration is present in map but type is present only in game causes load to fail
gui panels/gui panels do not respond to input
market bug/whole market object should be saved, not only market name
tile saving/default tiles should not be saved
triggers savings
maybe implement custom setattr and getattr for properties
when resized window with opened panel sometimes incorrect location
crash when close without loading a map
